MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large
data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a
key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value
pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate
values associated with the same intermediate key. Many
real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown
in the paper
